##### What we need to do:
- Website:
	- Make it pretty
	- Clean up the timeline
	- Write additional sections
		- Crime
		- Errors...
		- Prof. Ethics
	- Write bits about different technologies
		- For each of them, we can write a little or a lot about them
		- Probably not the focus - the presentation is more important.
		- We could add (date/probability of production, differences with the real thing)
		- For the most important tech, we can do a bit more
	- Edit + grammar check
		- Change Nubian (people from Sudan) -> Naboo

- Presentation: (Should just be salient points from conclusions)
  - Overview?
	- Robots vs. people
		- Robots are meant to be servants and are generally vastly inferior to people
			- Selling them is fine and moral, and they are not even considered slaves
		- Also, Aliens vs. Humans - The humans also look down on the aliens too (According to the Gungans), the major 'good guy' alien (Jar Jar Binks) is incompentent
	- Technology oddities
		- Encryption (except crypto-currency), recording, and non-hologram long distance communication doesn't appear to exist
		- Technical explanation for "The Force"
		- Impressive data transfer + processing for Droids
		- Good camera resolutions?
		- Robots are self aware
		- Robots don't have an efficient way to communicate (they talk amongst themselves)
		- Have some incredibly niche tools
			- Jedi carry around pocket microscope/short distance communicator, rebreathers, laser swords
			- Grappling hook + blasters carried by Naboo

	- How it relates to the real world: (maybe?)
		- Around the time of...
			- The Clinton Impeachment
			- War in Kosovo
		- But George Lucal started writing it in 1994, based on 15 pages he wrote in 1976
		- "the first film presented to the public with digital projection technology"
